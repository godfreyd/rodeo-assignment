# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

1. To start server, run the commands below:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:godfreyd/rodeo.git
    cd rodeo
    npm i
    npm run start:dev
    ```

1. Go to the link [https://localhost](https://localhost).

> Note: to stop server, run the command: `npm run down:dev`

P.S.: It was possible to calculate prices on the client, but usually all data is taken from the data base.
